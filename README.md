# EURO2020

This is the algorithm used to generate my EURO 2020 predictions for the inaugural CASUS trophy. It uses the 'tidyverse' package in R.

There are two files: an input data file and a script used to generate predictions.

The data file contains four columns:  
**home_team**: name of the home team  
**home_rank**: FIFA world ranking for the home team (as of 27 May 2021)  
**away_team**: name of the away team  
**home_rank**: FIFA world ranking for the away team (as of 27 May 2021)
